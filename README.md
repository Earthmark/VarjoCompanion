# VarjoCompanion
Because you can't have an app that uses both OpenVR and Varjo APIs.
This tiny application is supposed to be launched from the [my fork](https://github.com/m3gagluk/VRCFaceTracking) of the [benaclejames' VRCFaceTracking mod](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking). It starts a Varjo session and feeds the eye tracking data into the MemoryMappedFile which can then be read by a plugin
